# Data analysis with Python

This repository gathers the projects I realized to validate the freeCodeCamp's certification "Data Analysis with Python"

It includes 5 projects :

- [Mean - Variance - Standard Deviation](https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/project_standard-deviation) to get familiar with Numpy methods and data structures.
- [Demographic Data Analyser](https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/demographic-data-analyzer) to develop habits with importing csv and using Pandas
- [Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/medical-data-visualizer) to use matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas in concrete situation with data cleaning and data visualisation tasks.
- [Page view Time Visualizer](https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/page-view-time-series-visualizer) : create bar chart, box plots and line chart.
- [Sea Level Predictor](https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/sea-level-predictor) : realize a prediction from a dataset (predict the sea level change through year 205)

## What I learned through these projects :

- I developed habits manipulating numpy and pandas library for data cleaning and manipulation
- I learn how to apply statistical methods with Python (Linear regression)
- I am able to create quick visualisation with matplotlib & seaborn
- I learned to work with Jupyter Lab
