# Data analysis with Python
This repository gathers the projects I realized to validate the freeCodeCamp's certification "Data Analysis with Python"

It includes 5 projects : 
* [Mean - Variance - Standard Deviation]("https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/project_standard-deviation") to get familiar with Numpy methods and data structures.
* [Demographic Data Analyser]("https://github.com/lucasperretdev/freeCodeCamp_data-analysis-with-Python/tree/main/demographic-data-analyzer") to develop habits with importing csv and using Pandas

## What I learned through these projects : 
* I developed habits manipulating numpy and pandas library
* I learned to work with Jupyter Lab
